# songLyricsAnalysis_NLP
This project consists on web scrapping some websites in order to collect the data for song lyrics in 3 contries : Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia.
And also applying the preprocessing on the data in order to remove the non important things such as : the special characters, the stop words ... In the preprocessing, I also apply id the Lemmatization, the Stemming, The tokenization.
Then, I apply different methods like : TF-IDF, word2vec, Transformers.
